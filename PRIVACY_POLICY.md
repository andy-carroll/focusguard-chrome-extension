Last updated: July 24, 2025

We take your privacy seriously. This extension is designed to be completely private and secure.

## Data Collection

FocusGuard **does not** collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information or browsing data. We do not use any analytics, cookies, or tracking services.

## How Your Data is Handled

The only data the extension uses is the list of websites you choose to block. This list is:

- Stored **locally** on your computer using the `chrome.storage.sync` API.
- **Never** sent to our servers or any third party.
- Only accessible by you.

Your privacy is a core feature of this extension, not an afterthought.
